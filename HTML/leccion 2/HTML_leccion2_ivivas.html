            <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                Ipsum has been the industry's standard <em>dummy text ever</em> since the 1500s, when an
                unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                book.</p>
            <p>It has survived not only <strong>five centuries</strong>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
                of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                desktop publishing software like <i>Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</i></p>

            <h2 align="right" style="font-weight:normal;"><em>Where does it come from?</em></h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is not simply random text. It has roots in
                a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                <b>Richard McClintock</b>, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
                the undoubtable source.

            <h2 align="right" style="font-weight:normal"><em>Why do we use it?</em></h2>
            <p>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
                of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                <b>more-or-less normal distribution of letters</b>, as opposed to using 'Content here,
                content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
